## What is Natural Language Processing?  
Natural Language Processing is manipulation or understanding text or speech by any software or machine. An analogy is that humans interact, understand each other views, and respond with the appropriate answer. In NLP, this interaction, understanding, the response is made by a computer instead of a human.  

## What is NLTK?  
NLTK stands for Natural Language Toolkit. This toolkit is one of the most powerful NLP libraries which contains packages to make machines understand human language and reply to it with an appropriate response. Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization, Punctuation, Parsing, Chunking are some of these packages which will be discussed in this module.
